# hopfion-validation
Computational validation of Hopf fibration topology via dense fiber extraction and linking analysis.
Reproducible pipeline for sampling, visualizing, and quantifying topological linking (Lk ≈ ±1) across large ensembles of Hopf fibers derived from electromagnetic hopfion field structures. Includes numerical Gauss linking computation, closure verification, and interactive 3D visualizations.
